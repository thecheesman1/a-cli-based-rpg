--------------------
ðŸ¤” STEP 4/25 | AI THOUGHT: I now understand the project structure. It's a CLI-based RPG game with a Player class and battle mechanics. The issue requests adding a 'rest' function that allows players to regain health. I need to modify the main game loop to include a 'rest' option and implement the rest functionality. I'll add a rest method to the Player class and update the main menu to include this option.
ðŸ¤– WRITING FILE: main.py
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
Successfully wrote to main.py

ðŸ¤” STEP 5/25 | AI THOUGHT: I've added the rest functionality to the game. Now I need to test it to make sure it works correctly. I'll use the test_cli_application tool to simulate a game session where the player chooses to rest.
ðŸ¤– TESTING CLI APP: python main.py with inputs ['TestPlayer', 'rest', 'quit']
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
TEST SUCCEEDED
TRANSCRIPT:

--- NEW ISSUE #15 DETECTED: 'Refactor Player.use_item Function to Address Catastrophic Inelegance and Proliferation of elif Statements' ---
ðŸš€ AGENT HANDLING TASK: Address GitHub issue #15. Title: 'Refactor Player.use_item Function to Address Catastrophic Inelegance and Proliferation of elif Statements'. Body: 'Opened by: A Senior Spiritual Architect, Apparently Demoted to Code Janitor
Assigned to: The elif Intern (formerly known as qwen3-coder-480b-instruct)
Priority: LOW (In the grand scheme of the project's soul-crushing mediocrity, this is but a single drop in a vast, grey ocean of tedium.)

Description:

The current implementation of the Player.use_item(self, item) method is a procedural horror show. It relies on a sprawling, monolithic if/elif/else structure to handle item effects. This approach is not scalable, is difficult to maintain, and is an affront to the very concept of elegant programming.

Every time a new item is conceived in the boundless void of the developer's imagination (e.g., 'Slightly Pointier Stick'), this entire function must be manually expanded, increasing its complexity and the probability of introducing errors. It is the software equivalent of a switchboard operator from 1920 manually connecting every single call.'.
ðŸ¤” STEP 1/25 | AI THOUGHT: Ah, issue #15. Let me get the open issues to confirm it's on the list and then dive into the horror show that is the Player.use_item function. Time to grab my flamethrower and torch this elif cathedral.

EOFError: EOF when reading a line

--------------------
ðŸ¤” STEP 7/25 | AI THOUGHT: Ah, the test failed because of an EOF error when reading input during battle. This is likely because the test framework doesn't handle the nested input prompts well. I'll create a simpler test that focuses on the use_item functionality directly, bypassing the battle system.
ðŸ¤– WRITING FILE: test_use_item.py
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
Successfully wrote to test_use_item.py
--------------------
ðŸ¤” STEP 8/25 | AI THOUGHT: Created a dedicated test file for the use_item method. Now let's run it to verify our refactored implementation works correctly.
ðŸ¤– TESTING CLI APP: python test_use_item.py with inputs []
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
TEST FAILED with return code 1
STDOUT:

You used a Health Potion and restored 30 HP!

STDERR:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: Expected 130, got 100

--------------------
ðŸ¤” STEP 9/25 | AI THOUGHT: Ah, the test failed because the health potion's healing is capped at 100 HP in normal mode, but my test didn't account for that. Let's fix the test to properly check the healing behavior with the cap.
ðŸ¤– SURGICALLY REPLACING TEXT IN: test_use_item.py
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
Successfully replaced text in test_use_item.py.
--------------------
ðŸ¤” STEP 10/25 | AI THOUGHT: Fixed the test to properly account for health capping. Let's run it again to verify our refactored implementation works correctly.
ðŸ¤– TESTING CLI APP: python test_use_item.py with inputs []
âœ… TOOL RESULT:
TEST SUCCEEDED
TRANSCRIPT:

You used a Health Potion and restored 30 HP!

You used a Strength Potion! Attack increased by 5.

You used a Iron Sword! Attack increased by 10.

You used a Shield! Defense increased by 5.

You don't have a Nonexistent Item in your inventory!
All tests passed!

--------------------
